# Swift_Playground
Repo for my playing around with Swift/SwiftUI

WatchLandmarks: Was a test for Apple's example of a National Landmark Viewer, but now is empty.

AppleWatchTestNew: Notificaiton tester

NotificationTest: Was rewritten to be a simple app testing a button, allowing you to change the color of some elements.
